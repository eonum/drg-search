# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  intro_title: "Analysis of the number of cases per DRG"
  intro_lead: "The “Analysis of the number of cases per DRG” indicates the number of hospital stays for a specific
              DRG and allows this figure to be compared from one year to the next, thereby indirectly offering an insight
              into the experience of a hospital with regard to the interventions analysed."
  intro_subtitle1: "Funding of Swiss hospitals since 01.01.12"
  intro_subparam1: "Since 1 January 2012, SwissDRG (Swiss Diagnosis Related Groups) has been the tariff system
                    employed in Switzerland to pay for acute-care hospital services. Like the flat rate per case
                    system, SwissDRG regulates the payment of hospital services in a consistent and all-inclusive
                    approach in accordance with the latest revision of the Health Insurance Act. Each hospital stay
                    is thus assigned to a particular pathology group and paid for on an all-inclusive basis
                    according to defined criteria (primary diagnosis, supplementary diagnoses, treatments, etc.).
                    The SwissDRG tariff structure is established each year on the basis of new data, taking into
                    account the updated Swiss classification of surgical interventions (CHOP) and the International
                    Classification of Diseases (ICD)."
  intro_subtitle2: "The “Analysis of the number of cases per DRG” application"
  intro_subparam2: "The “Analysis of the number of cases per DRG” application can display the number of cases in
                    a diagnosis-related group (basic DRG, DRG, MDC) for a specific hospital, for the year in which a particular
                    tariff structure applies. The general public can use this tool to find out the number of
                    hospital stays for a specific DRG and compare this figure from one year to the next.
                    Indirectly, this comparison provides some idea of the frequency of occurrence of a type
                    of intervention in a specific hospital, and thus the experience possessed by the hospital
                    in these interventions. As a result, the analysis of the number of cases per DRG can
                    increase transparency in the free choice of hospitals."
